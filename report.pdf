This process involved cleaning a global temperature dataset by first extracting relevant columns 
(dt, AverageTemperature, and Country) and filtering out data from specific continents. 
We identified and counted the rows with missing temperature values (5.6% of the total dataset) and used a MapReduce job 
to calculate the median temperature for each country. The missing temperature values were then imputed using 
the corresponding country's median temperature. The cleaned dataset, with all missing values filled, 
was saved for further analysis.
